TRIANGLE TRACKER PROGRAM

This program (TRIANGLE TRACKER PROGRAM)is developed by MUSANABANDI CLAUDINE.

It helps in tracking the type of triangle by intering the three sides of triangle.

Triangle tracking

1. To form a triangle we need three sides taken as inputs
   eg:A,B,C
2. we need out put message to know what kind of triangle we have based on enterd value and checking conditions.
   those mesages are:INVALID INPUTS,THIS IS EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE,THIS IS ISOSCELENES TRIANGLE,THIS IS SCALENE TRIANGLE,
   CAN NOT FORM A TRIANGLE, THIS IS NOT VALID NUMBERS.

3. define invalid input
   eg:sides that have lenght less than or equals to zero (A<=0 or B<=0 0r c<=0 or both sides equal to zero or negative values).
   if this conditioin is not true

   eg:, 0,0,0

4. check if triangle is equilateral by cheking if all its sides are equal
   (A === C && A === B && B === C)
   eg:12,12,12.

   if this condition also is also not true

5. it checks if triangle is isosceles by checking if it has any two sides which are equal
   A === B || A === C || B === C)
   eg:25,25,9.

also when it found this condition not satisified

6. it checks if inputed sides form a scalene triangle by checking to see
   if all sides are different (no side equal to another)and the sum of any two sides is greater than the rest one
   (AB > C && AC > B && BC > A && A != B && A != C && B != C)
   eg:78,34,56.

7. after check if given sides can form a triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides are not less than or equal to the rest one
   when the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third one; those can note form a triangle
   (AB <= C || AC <= B || BC <= A)
   eg: 4,3,9

8. after; all rest conditions and inputs are fallen into ELSE category
   eg
