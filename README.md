1. define invalid input
  eg:sides that have lenght less than or equals to zero (A<=0 or B<=0 0r c<=0 or both sides equal to zero or negative values).
  if this conditioin is not true

2. check if triangle is equilateral by cheking if all its sides are equal
    
      eg:12,12,12.
     
    if this condition also is also not true

3. it checks if triangle is isosceles by checking if it has any two sides which are equal
      eg:25,25,9.
      also when it found this condition not satisified

4. it checks if inputed sides form a scalene triangle by checking
